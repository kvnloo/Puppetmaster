"""Where ``@cursor/sdk`` lives so the cursor adapter survives reinstalls.

PyPI wheels cannot ship ``node_modules``, and ``uv tool upgrade`` / ``pipx
upgrade`` build a fresh environment, so an SDK bootstrapped next to the
installed package vanishes on every upgrade. The SDK home under the app state
root is version-independent instead.

Node resolves ESM bare specifiers from the importing file and ignores
``NODE_PATH``, so the runner has to execute *beside* the SDK it imports. When
only the SDK home has it, a byte-identical copy of the packaged runner is
placed there and run from that directory.
